# Machine Failure Prediction

Predictive modeling for machine failure using a Random Forest classifier. This repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and exploratory data analysis.

## Overview

Machine failure prediction is a critical task in industrial settings, where identifying potential issues in machinery can prevent downtime and increase overall efficiency. This project focuses on building a predictive model using a Random Forest classifier to anticipate machine failures based on various operational parameters.

## Contents

- **data/:** Folder containing the dataset (`ai4i2020.csv`) used for training and testing the machine failure prediction model.
- **scripts/:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and exploratory data analysis.
- **results/:** Folder to store any result files or visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZakariaeBAHARI/machine-failure-prediction.git
